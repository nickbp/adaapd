This is a DAAP server with the design goals of simple configuration and efficient operation.
Use it to access your media library over a local network or over the internet.

It's not done yet, so there aren't really any build instructions yet. When it's finished or thereabouts, the expected dependencies are:

- CMake (build handler)
- google-test (optional, for unit tests)
- sqlite (persistent library information)
- Ragel (state machine for the daap service itself)
- libev (async file/socket event handling)
- taglib (media file metadata)
- inotify (ergo linux-only for now. kevent support may come later?)
